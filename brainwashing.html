			The film's main focus is how dangerous it is to go to the center of the earth. This is a direct assault on free thinking. The film is a cautionary tale aimed to dissuade the public from ever finding out the truth about the center of the earth by their own emperical testing.

		<h3>Education</h3>

			The educational system is rife with lies told about the center of the earth. Take for instance the classic earth cutaway used to indoctrinate the unwashed masses.
