		<h2>Entertainment</h2>
		<p>
			One of the most glaring examples of fear mongering in the attempt to hinder the truth from coming out is the 2003 film <i>The Core</i>.

			The film's main focus is how dangerous it is to go to the center of the earth. This is a direct assault on free thinking. The film is a cautionary tale aimed to dissuade the public from ever finding out the truth about the center of the earth by their own emperical testing.

		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>
			The educational system is rife with lies told about the center of the earth. Take for instance the classic earth cutaway used to indoctrinate the unwashed masses.

			The educators of the world would have you believe that the earths center is a hot ball of molten metal to try and keep you away from it. Even a cursory experiemnt can prove this to be a lie. Simply go outside and put your hand on the ground. Surely if the earth was full of molten metal, the ground would be extremely hot. WRONG
