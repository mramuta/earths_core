			Here is a website on a similar topic to mine, <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/hollowearth.html">link</a>.
			Visually, both of the websites have a similar feel. Style wise, the creator of this site used more styling to create a nicely formated way of reading it. In the html code the author only separates his paragraphs with paragraph tags insteaad of using tags that provide semantic meaning. Also the author should give proper credit to his photos that he uses, assumin that he did not create all of them.
